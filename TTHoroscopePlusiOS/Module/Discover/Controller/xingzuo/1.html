			Palmistry reveals individual personality and character traits through the study of the shape, size and lines of the hands and fingers. There are two divisions within this ancient science. Chiromancy deals with the lines on the palm and chirognomy deals with the shape of the hands and the color, shape and texture of the palm, fingers and thumb.
		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			The general consensus among most palm readers, with respect to what each hand indicates (right and left) is this — for right-handed individuals, the left hand lines and shapes indicate the character traits, personality and destiny one is born with. The right hand lines and shapes show the direction one’s life has taken. For left-handed individuals the opposite applies. However, depending upon the palm reader and his or her training or country of origin, this may vary.

			The palm of the hand has three major lines — the life line, heart line and head line. The line on the palm that people are most curious about is the life line. This line begins between the index finger and the thumb and continues downward toward the base of the thumb and the connection to the wrist. The heart line, also known as the love line or mensal line, gives an indication about a person’s emotional state and their emotional and physical relationships with others. It can also be looked at as a predictor of the health of the heart. The head line, also known as the wisdom line (considered one of the most important lines in Chinese palmistry), reveals mental and psychological makeup and intellectual development and intuitive abilities.

			Life Line
		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			The line on the palm that people are most curious about is the life line. This line begins between the index finger and the thumb and continues downward toward the base of the thumb and the connection to the wrist. A common misconception about the life line is that it reveals how long you will live or when you will die. It does however, reveal information about the encounters in your life, relationships with others, health and physical and emotional well-being.
		</div>
		<div class="mt">

		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			<b>Long and deep line</b> — Indicates good health, stamina, vitality and a well-balanced individual.
		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			<b>Short and deep line</b>  — Indicates the ability to overcome physical problems. It is a myth that a short life line signifies a short life. If the life line is short and shallow, it may signify that other people can easily influence or control you.
		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			<b> Deep line</b> — Indicates a smoother life path.
		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			<b>Faint line</b>  — Indicates a person with low energy and having a less adventurous life.
		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			<b>Broken line</b>  — Indicates struggles, losses, unexpected change or interruption in your way of living, an accident or an illness. A break in the life line on one hand can signify that you may get ill and recover quickly. A break in the life line on both hands can signify that you may suffer a serious illness or disease. If there is a break near the wrist area in the line, it can indicate problems in early childhood.
		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			<b>Chained line</b>  — You are susceptible to health or emotional problems. You may also experience a life path that takes you in many directions.
		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			<b>Forked line</b>  — This type of line has various meanings depending on the fork placement on the hand. Generally, forks indicate an interruption, redirection or life change. It can sometimes mean that you are surrounded by scattered or split energies. If it leads to the Mount of Jupiter, it indicates success and recognition. If it forks to the Mount of Moon it indicates traveling to far off places.
		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			<b>Double or triple line</b>  — Indicates that you are surrounded by positive energies and you have great stamina. You might possibly be a twin or have found a true partner and soul mate, or you have someone watching over you. However, it may also mean that you are living a double life.
		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			<b>Absent line</b>  — Indicates a high-strung, anxious and nervous individual.
		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			<b>Branched line</b>  — Upward branches indicate achievement and success and downward branches indicate poor physical and emotional health, money problems, feelings of sadness and loss. Lines extending up and above the life line show an ability to recover from situations. Lines extending below the life line signify habitually wasting energy.

			Heart Line
		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			The heart line, also known as the love line or mensal line, gives an indication about a person’s emotional state and their emotional and physical relationships with others. It can also be looked at as a predictor of the health of the heart. This line is located above the head line and life line. It starts either under the index finger or middle finger, and extends toward the pinky finger.
		</div>
		<div class="mt">
			This line is located above the head line and life line. It starts either under the index finger or middle finger, and extends toward the pinky finger. Some clues about love and relationships are revealed just by the position of the line on the palm. If the heart line begins underneath the index finger, it is an indication that you are satisfied with your love life, or it could mean that you are picky about who you choose to have a relationship with. If it begins underneath the middle finger, this can signify a self-centered approach to love, or you are consumed by the need to be loved. A line that starts between the middle and index fingers indicates that you are quick to give away your love. If the line crosses the fate line, it can indicate the possibility of a relationship loss.
